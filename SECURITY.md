## `1.` I FOUND AN ERROR
If you have viewed the code and found any part that may be vulnerable to your application, impair performance or have other adverse effects on your application, it is extremely important to report this as a security issue. Open an Issue reporting the problem you found and in a few moments (or more) your problem will be placed as a priority and little by little it will be corrected until there are no more problems!

Your help is extremely important for rapid and practical evolution, as it is YOU who will develop and make your applications and having feedback on what to improve is extremely important, that said, do not hesitate to report problems or things that can be improved.
