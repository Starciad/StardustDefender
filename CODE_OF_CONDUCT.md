<h2 align="center">✨ ● CODE OF CONDUCT ● ✨</h2>

Welcome to the Stellar Duelist code of conduct, in this document there is important information about how you (along with the community) should act during the development and interaction with the game.

<br/>

## `1.` OUR COMMITMENT
We, as members, contributors and leaders, are committed to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, national origin, personal appearance, race, religion or identity and sexual orientation.

</br>

## `2.` OUR STANDARDS
So that everything is tolerated correctly and amicably, below is a short list of how to act during any type of interaction during the project:

- Demonstrate empathy and kindness towards other people;
- Respect different opinions, points of view and experiences;
- Kindly give and accept constructive feedback;
- Have respect for other members and do not create intrigues.

</br>

## `3.` GENERAL RULES
Below is a list of rules that may result in future punishments for sinners who commit them, pay attention to the limits imposed in the project so that there are no loopholes for punishments:

- The use of violent language or indirect/extremely sexualized images and sexual attention or advances of any kind to any member of the community;
- Insulting, harassing or derogatory comments and personal or political attacks;
- Public or private harassment;
- Publish other people's private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission;

</br>

## `4.` ADMINISTRATION
Management leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take respectful and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they consider inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not covered by this Code of Conduct and to communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

</br>

## `5.` SCOPE
This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and also when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting through an official social media account, or serving as a named representative at an online or offline event.

</br>

## `6.` APPLICATION GUIDELINES
Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when determining the consequences of any action they believe violates this Code of Conduct. The level of punishment for each infraction committed will depend on the context and development of events, after which a small meeting will be held to decide what will be the best punishment for such an act committed.
